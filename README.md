# batterylog
Linux laptop battery logging tool

A simple Python app with few dependencies that reads your sysfs-class-power numbers and records them to a local sqlite3 db with an "event" tag.

It was built to track suspend power usage for Framework laptops, but is flexible/easily extensible to do all kinds of other stuff.


# Running
Makes sure you meet the requirements, clone the repo, and run `INSTALL.sh` - this will move the cloned repo to `/opt/batterylog` and install the script that logs into a sqlite3 DB at `/opt/batterylog/batterylog.db`.

You can run `/opt/batterylog/batterylog` without any parameters and it will calculate the power usage from the last suspend/resume cycle:

```
$ /opt/batterylog/batterylog
Slept for 8.72 hours
Used 6.10 Wh, an average rate of 0.70 W
For your 53.67 Wh battery this is 1.30%/hr or 31.29%/day
```

This script should work w/ any laptop that has a battery available via `sysfs` (it looks for the first battery located by `/sys/class/power_supply/BAT*`). This script has currently only been tested with a Framework laptop and the script doesn't check that all values exist (some batteries don't report some values). It's small enough though that it should be easy to debug/modify for your own purposes. Also, while it stores and keeps all historical values in sqlite, it doesn't really do much else, like have a UI for exposing previous sleeps, etc yet.

The expectation for this release is that the user would be comfortable writing some of their own queries or scripts if they want to do more.
